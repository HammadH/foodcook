<h4 class='thin'>Take a moment and think about the number of times you order food from restaurants.</h4>

<h4 class='thin'>If its more than 5 times a week, you my friend need some good food.</h4><br>

<h4 class='thin'>Introducing 44cooks.com, a place to find amazing food cooked by home and professional chefs.</h4>

<h4 class='thin'>Be it for parties, social gatherings, date nights or just your daily lunch. You can find 
awesome cooks from your neighbourhood to cook for you.</h4>
<br>

<h4 class='thin'>The idea was to create an open place where busy individuals can find healthy and cheap food by finding home cooks in their neighbourhood. To be honest we were quite fedup with ordering restaurant food which is unhealthy and expensive which is why we were looking for alternatives in the first place.</h4>
<br>

<h4 class='thin'>We then came to know there are people around us who offered cooking services, they either come home and cook or deliver fresh food to your home. And some of them are really talented cooks!</h4>
<br>

<h4> With so many people cooking all this awesome food around us we had to eat it! But there was just one problem, we couldn't find them..</h4> 
<br>
<h4 class='thin'>So we thought there should be a place where we can find these people and ask them to cook for us. And so we built we built 44cooks.com. Now anyone who wants to cook can sign up and people who needs food can easily find them.</h4>
<br>
<h4 class='thin'>So the next time you are thinking of a party or dinner with your girlfriend call a chef and have him cook at
home. And don't worry about the prices, some of them are as low as 100 AED.</h4><br>

<h4 class='thin'>Happy cooking!</h4>
